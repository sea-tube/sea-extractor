# Sea Extractor

Simple micro-service REST API solution to extract data and metadata from videos such as thumbnails.

Ideally, we will soon have a more decentralized mechanism to carry out this process.

The service works with peertube links and soon with IPFS CIDs.

### Running:

Install dependencies:

```yarn```

Run as dev:

```yarn dev```

Endpoints:

#### /v1/thumbs
